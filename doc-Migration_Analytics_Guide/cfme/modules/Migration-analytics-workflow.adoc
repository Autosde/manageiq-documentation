image:circle_1.png[20,20] In the CloudForms user interface, you perform a SmartState analysis scan on your VMware virtual machines.

image:circle_2.png[20,20] Data about operating systems and workloads is collected from the VMware virtual machines.

The following workloads are currently supported:

* JBoss Core Service Apache HTTP server with `mod_cluster` configured
* JBoss EAP
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* Apache Tomcat
* Oracle Weblogic
* IBM WebSphere
* Microsoft SQL

image:circle_3.png[20,20] The data from the VMware virtual machines is collected in an inventory data file, which you can download to your local machine to view.

image:circle_4.png[20,20] In a browser, you navigate to the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[Migration Analytics service] and create a report. The Migration Analytics service uploads the inventory data file and analyzes it.
