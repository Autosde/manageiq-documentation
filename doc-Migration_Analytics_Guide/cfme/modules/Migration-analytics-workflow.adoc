* JBoss Core Service Apache HTTP server with `mod_cluster` configured
* JBoss EAP
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* Apache Tomcat
* Oracle Weblogic
* IBM WebSphere
* Microsoft SQL

image:circle_3.png[20,20] You use Migration Analytics, in CloudForms, to create an inventory data file, which you can copy to your local machine to view.

image:circle_4.png[20,20] In a browser, you navigate to the Migration Analytics service at link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[https://cloud.redhat.com/beta] and create a report. The Migration Analytics service uploads the inventory data file and analyzes it.
