= Scanning the virtual machines

You can scan the vSphere virtual machines with SmartState analysis in CloudForms.

SmartState analysis uses the default VM analysis profile.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some virtual machines should not be analyzed because the snapshot process may cause data corruption.

These virtual machines are primarily those running on Windows operating systems with workloads requiring numerous transactions and disk read/write operations, for example, Microsoft Exchange Server, SharePoint, SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

You can exclude a virtual machine from the scan by assigning to it the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0-beta/html-single/managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index#to_tag_virtual_machines_and_templates[`exclusions` tag, with the `do_not_analyze` value].

.Prerequisites

* SmartState analysis and SmartProxy must be enabled.
* You must have a valid VM analysis profile called `default`.

.Procedure

. Log in to the CloudForms user interface.
. Navigate to *Compute* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Select the virtual machines that you want to scan.
. Click *Configuration* -> *Perform SmartState Analysis*. Each virtual machine can take up to one minute to scan.
. Click your username image:user.png[] -> *Tasks* -> *My VM and Container Analysis Tasks*.
. From the *Zone* list, select *<All Zones>*.
. From the *24 Hour Time Period* list, select the period of time to view the tasks.
. For *Task Status*, select the check boxes next to the status to view.
