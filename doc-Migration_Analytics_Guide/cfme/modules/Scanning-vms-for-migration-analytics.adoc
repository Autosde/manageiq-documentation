= Scanning the virtual machines

You must scan the VMware virtual machines with SmartState analysis in Red Hat CloudForms.

SmartState analysis uses the VM analysis profile, `default`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some virtual machines should not be analyzed because the snapshot process may cause data corruption.

These virtual machines are primarily those running on Windows operating systems with workloads requiring numerous transactions and disk read/write operations, for example, Microsoft Exchange Server, SharePoint, SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

You can exclude a virtual machine from the scan by assigning to it the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0/html-single/managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index#to_tag_virtual_machines_and_templates[`exclusions` tag, with the `do_not_analyze` value].
====

.Prerequisites

* SmartState analysis and SmartProxy must be enabled.
* You must have a valid VM analysis profile called `default`. If you create an alternate analysis profile, you must assign it with its own control policy.

.Procedure

. Log in to the CloudForms user interface.
. Navigate to *Compute* -> *Infrastructure* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Select the virtual machines that you want to scan.
. Click *Configuration* -> *Perform SmartState Analysis*.
+
Each virtual machine can take up to one minute to scan.

. To view the results of the scan:

.. Click your username image:user.png[] -> *Tasks* -> *My VM and Container Analysis Tasks*.
.. From the *Zone* list, select *<All Zones>*.
.. From the *24 Hour Time Period* list, select the period of time for the tasks you want to view.
.. For *Task Status*, select the check boxes next to the status that you want to view.
.. From the *Tasks State* list, select the state you want to view.
.. Click *Apply*.
+
The results of the SmartState analysis scan appear in each virtual machine's details page.
