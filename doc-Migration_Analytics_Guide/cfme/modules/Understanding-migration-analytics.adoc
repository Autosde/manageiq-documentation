= Understanding Migration Analytics

Migration Analytics enables you to examine your VMware virtual machines and collect data about their operating systems and workloads, using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms] user interface.

You then use the Migration Analytics service at link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[https://cloud.redhat.com/beta] to analyze the data and create a report. This report provides an estimate of the initial savings in migrating to Red Hat, a detailed analysis of the VMware virtual machines, and recommendations to help you plan your migration.

[NOTE]
====
Migration Analytics is available as a technology preview in this release of CloudForms. For more information on the support scope for features marked as technology previews, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

== Migration Analytics workflow

The following workflow assumes that you have installed CloudForms on VMware 6.0 (or later), added your VMware environment as an infrastructure provider to CloudForms, and configured Migration Analytics.

image:circle_1.png[20,20] In the CloudForms user interface, you perform a SmartState analysis scan on the VMware virtual machines.

image:circle_2.png[20,20] Data about operating systems and workloads is collected from the VMware virtual machines. The following workloads are supported:

* JBoss Core Service Apache HTTP server with `mod_cluster` configured
* JBoss EAP
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* Apache Tomcat
* Oracle Weblogic
* IBM WebSphere
* Microsoft SQL

image:circle_3.png[20,20] You use Migration Analytics, in CloudForms, to create an inventory data file, which you can copy to your local machine to view.

image:circle_4.png[20,20] In a browser, you navigate to the Migration Analytics service at link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[https://cloud.redhat.com/beta] and create a report. The Migration Analytics service uploads the inventory data file and analyzes it.

image:circle_5.png[20,20] The Migration Analytics service generates a report describing the estimated savings, the complexity of the migration, and migration recommendations.

[id='Migration-analytics-report']
== Migration Analytics report

The Migration Analytics report provides the following information:

* Initial savings estimation
+
This section describes the estimated savings realized by migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization over a three-year period, based on the data retrieved from the infrastructure. The savings estimates are broken down into VMware maintenance costs, Red Hat Virtualization costs, and Red Hat training and services.

* Workload migration summary
+
This section describes the complexity of the migration and provides detailed workload data. A pie chart displays the complexity of migrations:
+
** *Easy*: Virtual machine with no unusual configuration
** *Medium*: For example, virtual machine with more than four vNICs or a shared disk
** *Hard*: For example, a virtual machine with Raw Device Mapping
** *Unknown*: Unidentified operating system, for example, FreeBSD 12

* Workload migration inventory
+
This section displays a list of the virtual machines to be migrated, with detailed information about the workload, operating system, estimated migration effort, and recommended migration targets.
