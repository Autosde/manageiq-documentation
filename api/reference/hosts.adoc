[[querying-hosts]]
=== Querying Hosts

Hosts are queried via the primary collection URL:

[source,data]
----
/api/hosts
----

[[edit-hosts]]
=== Editing a Host

Currently, only the host password can be edited via the API. All other edit requests will be
rejected.

The host password is provided by a _credentials_ hash similar to the signature supported
for providers.

----
POST /api/hosts/:id
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "edit",
  "resource" : {
    "credentials" : {
      "password" : "updated_password"
    }
  }
}
----

When not specified, the authentication type used for the password is _default_:

----
POST /api/hosts/:id
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "edit",
  "resource" : {
    "credentials" : {
      "auth_type" : "default",
      "password" : "updated_password"
    }
  }
}
----

Password for multiple hosts can also be updated with a single request as follows:

----
POST /api/hosts
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "edit",
  "resources" : [
    { "id" : "101", "credentials" : { "password" : "updated_password" } },
    { "id" : "102", "credentials" : { "password" : "updated_password" } },
    { "id" : "103", "credentials" : { "password" : "updated_password" } },
    ...
  ]
}
----

[NOTE]

host can be referenced by *href* or *id*
