== Re-migrating Virtual Machines

If a migration fails for any reason (for example, network communication between the source and target providers is disrupted during the migration process), you can re-migrate the virtual machines:

. Delete the target virtual machines that were created during the failed migration. Not doing so will cause the migration to fail because a target machine with the same name already exists.
. Create a xref:CSV_import[CSV file] with the names and, optionally, providers, of the source virtual machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
The virtual machines cannot be discovered by the migration plan because they are marked in the CloudForms VMDB as `migrated`.
====

. Create and run a migration plan, using the CSV file to import the virtual machines.

== Log Files

If a migration plan does not complete successfully, check the logs for errors:

* CloudForms migration log: `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log`
* Conversion host logs: `/tmp`

== Common Issues and Mistakes

* Incorrect infrastructure mapping.
+
If you create an infrastructure mapping and subsequently add or remove providers or provider objects, the infrastructure mapping will not work. This is because the object IDs of the providers and their objects have changed. You must delete the infrastructure mapping and re-create it.

* RHV host credentials are not set in CloudForms.
+
Authorize the xref:Authenticating_RHV_Manager_and_Hosts[RHV hosts].

* RHV conversion host tags not set correctly.*(%AP: Can this happen if the user is configuring the conversion host with conversion_host.yml?)*
+
Set the appropriate tags for the RHV conversion hosts.
Ensure RHV hosts are configured as conversion hosts.
Run the Conversion_host_check.yml playbook to verify.

* Incorrect attributes in the virtual machine CSV import file.
+
Check the CloudForms migration log to identify the errors. Create a new migration plan, import the correct CSV file, and run the migration plan.
