= Discovery and Assessment

The discovery and assessment phase is the foundation of the planning phase of your migration. At the end of this phase, you will formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months." To help you formulate a migration goal, you must discover and assess your current environment.
