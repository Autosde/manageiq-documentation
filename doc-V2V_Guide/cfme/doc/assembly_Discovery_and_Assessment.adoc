= Discovery and Assessment

The discovery and assessment phase is the foundation of the planning phase of your migration. At the end of this phase, you will formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months." To help you formulate a migration goal, you must discover and assess your current environment.

Currently, the Infrastructure Migration Solution supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.

The power state of the migrated virtual machines is preserved: a virtual machine that is powered on or off before migration will be in the same power state after migration.
