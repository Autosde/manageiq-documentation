A well-planned migration is critical for success. During the planning process, you should focus on the following tasks:

* Create playbooks to automate pre-migration tasks.
* Create migration groups, taking the following into consideration:

** How are the virtual machines grouped?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** What workloads should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Schedule your migration, to minimize the impact on your users.
