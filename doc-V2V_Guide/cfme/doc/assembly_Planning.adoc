A well-planned migration is critical for success. During the planning process, you should focus on the following tasks:

* Create playbooks to automate pre-migration tasks.
* Create migration groups, taking the following into consideration:

** How are the virtual machines grouped?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** What workloads should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Schedule your migration, to minimize the impact on your users.

== Best Practices

* Keep linked applications together and migrate at the same time.
* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.
* Plan for redundancy.
* Ensure that you have sufficient space for the migration. The migration process does not delete the original virtual machines.
* Stagger migration schedules.
* Prepare your users for downtime.
* Minimize the impact on your environment, possibly by throttling bandwidth usage.
