= Discovery

You can use CloudForms to discover your infrastructure providers.

The discovery stage is critical for planning your migration. It will help you to answer the following questions:

* What is the source environment that I will be migrating?
* Does my target environment have sufficient resources for the migration? Is it lacking any resources, such as bandwidth or storage?
* How long will the migration take?
* How will the migration affect the users? (Currently, {product-title} supports only cold migration.) Will they require access to critical applications during the migration?

The discovery procedure has 2 key stages:

* Discover the VMware and Red Hat Virtualization infrastructure providers.
* Authenticate Red Hat Virtualization Manager and hosts.
