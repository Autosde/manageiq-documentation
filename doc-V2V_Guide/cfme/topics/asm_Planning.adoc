== Planning

A well-planned migration is critical for success.

You should consider the following questions when planning your migration:

* Schedule:
** How do I schedule the migration?
** What downtime can I anticipate?
* Virtual machines:
** How are the virtual machines grouped?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
* Workloads:
** What workloads need to migrate together?
** What applications must remain available?
