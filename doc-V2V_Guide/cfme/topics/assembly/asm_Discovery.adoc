[[Discovery]]
== Discovery
:procdir: ../procedure

The discovery stage is critical for planning your migration. It will help you to answer the following question:

* What is the source environment that I will be migrating?
* Does my target environment have sufficient resources for the migration?
* Am I missing any resources, such as bandwidth or storage?
* How long will the migration take?
* How will the migration affect the users? (Currently, {{product-title}} supports only cold migration.)
