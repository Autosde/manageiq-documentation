Discovering the source environment with Cloud Forms (What am I migrating?)

Scaling - minimum and max size migrations? At least a note about max size

Planning the target environment (What will I need to hold it?)

Identifying resource gaps (What am I missing? Ex: bandwidth, storage, licenses, maintenance window) - a reminder

Estimating the time requirements (How long will it take? How long do I have?)

Determining the impact on others (Will this disrupt the production environment? Will users lack access to critical applications?)
