=== Installing CloudForms

The procedure for installing CloudForms on your Red Hat Virtualization system has 3 key stages:

* Downloading the CloudForms appliance
* Creating a virtual machine based on the appliance
* Configuring CloudForms

==== Downloading the CloudForms Appliance

Download the CloudForms appliance from the Red Hat Customer Portal:

. Go to link:https://access.redhat.com/[access.redhat.com] and log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal using your customer account details.
. Click *Downloads* in the menu bar.
. Click *A-Z* to sort the product downloads alphabetically.
. Click *Red Hat CloudForms* to access the product download page.
. From the list of installers and images, click the *Download Now* link for the CFME Red Hat Virtual Appliance (qcow).

You are ready to upload the CloudForms appliance to your Red Hat Virtualization environment and to create a virtual machine.

==== Uploading the CloudForms Appliance

Upload the QCOW2 CloudForms appliance to the data storage domain, using the Administration Portal:

. Click menu:Storage[Disks].
. Select *Start* from the *Upload* menu. 
. Click *Choose File* and select the appliance to upload.
. Fill in the *Disk Options* fields. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#Explanation_of_Settings_in_the_New_Virtual_Disk_Window[Explanation of Settings in the New Virtual Disk Window] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_ for descriptions of the relevant fields.
. Click *OK*.
+
A progress bar indicates the status of the upload. You can pause, cancel, or resume uploads from the *Upload* menu.

*Increasing the Upload Timeout Value*

. If the upload times out and you see the message, *Reason: timeout due to transfer inactivity*, increase the timeout value:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# engine-config -s TransferImageClientInactivityTimeoutInSeconds=6000
----
. Restart the `ovirt-engine` service:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# systemctl restart ovirt-engine
----

==== Creating a Template Based on the CloudForms Appliance

After you have uploaded the CloudForms appliance to your data storage domain, you import the appliance image as a template and create a virtual machine based on this template:

*(%AP: This needs to be clarified because no template import tab for data domain. Question sent to Dave Johnson. First version is from VMM, second is from CF install guide.)*

. Click menu:Storage[Domains] and select the data storage domain.
. Click the domain name to go to the details view.
. Click the *Template Import* tab and select the image you uploaded.
. Click menu:More Actions[Import].
. Select the templates to import.
. Use the drop-down lists to select the *Destination Cluster* and *Storage* domain.
. Click btn:[OK] to import templates and open a notification window. Click *Close* to close the notification window.

The template is imported into the destination data center. This can take up to an hour, depending on your storage hardware. You can view the import progress in the *Events* tab.

. Import the appliance image from the data storage domain as a template in a Red Hat Virtualization data storage domain: 
.. Click the *Storage* tab, and select the export storage domain you uploaded the image to.
.. From the details pane, click the *Template Import* tab, and select the image (`newimagename`) you uploaded.
.. Click *Import*, and specify the *Cluster* and *CPU Profile* as desired.
.. Click *OK*.
. Check whether the template has a network interface (NIC). If the template does not include one, create a NIC for it:
.. From the *Templates* tab, select the template you imported to view its details.
.. From the details pane, click the *Network Interfaces* tab to check if a NIC is listed. If there is an existing NIC, continue to the next step. If no existing NIC is shown:
... Create a NIC by clicking *New* in the *Network Interfaces* tab.  
... In the *New Network Interface* dialog, specify any values as desired or leave the defaults. 
... Click *OK*.
+
The new NIC shows in the *Network Interfaces* tab.

==== Creating a Virtual Machine Based on the CloudForms Template

. Create a new virtual machine using the CloudForms appliance template as a basis:
.. From the *Templates* tab, select the CloudForms template.
.. Click *New VM* to open the *New Virtual Machine* dialog. 
.. Specify a name for the virtual machine, and any other details as desired. 
.. Click *OK*.
+
The virtual machine is created. To view the virtual machine, select the data center, then the *Virtual Machines* tab to view a list of all virtual machines.
. Add a database disk if you are hosting the database on the same machine as the appliance:
//From BZ1411114 - â€œhow big?  Thin or thick provisioned?  (Anything else to consider?)
.. To add a disk, select your virtual machine from the *Virtual Machines* tab.
.. From the details pane, click the *Disks* tab. 
.. Click *New* to open the *New Virtual Disk* dialog.
ifdef::cfme[.. Specify a *Size* in GB for the disk that allows sufficient space for your database. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/deployment_planning_guide/introduction#database-requirements[Database Requirements] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_ for size considerations.]
ifdef::miq[.. Specify a *Size* in GB for the disk that allows sufficient space for your database. See "Database Requirements" in the _Deployment Planning Guide_ for size considerations.]
.. Set the *Allocation Policy* to `Preallocated` (thick provisioning) for best performance.
.. Specify any other values as desired.
.. Click *OK* to create the disk.
. To start the CloudForms appliance, select the virtual machine from the *Virtual Machines* tab and click image:greentriangle.png[] (*Run*). 

Your Red Hat Virtualization environment now contains a running CloudForms appliance.
