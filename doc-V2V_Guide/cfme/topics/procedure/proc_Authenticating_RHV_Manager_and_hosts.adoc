==== Authenticating Red Hat Virtualization Manager

After you have discovered Red Hat Virtualization Manager, you must authenticate the Manager so that CloudForms can connect:

. Select the appropriate *Zone* for the provider.
  By default, the zone is set to *default*.
. In the *Credentials* area, under *Default*, provide the login credentials  for the Manager administrative user:
* Enter the user name (formatted as `admin@internal`) in the *Username* field.
* Enter the password in the *Password* field.
* Confirm the password in the *Confirm Password* field.
* Click *Validate* to confirm CloudForms can connect to the Manager.
. Click *Add*.

After authenticating the Manager, you must authenticate its hosts. You can use the administrator credentials.
