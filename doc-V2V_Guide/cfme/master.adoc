[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

{product-title} is Red Hat's solution for moving your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization.

Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) is an enterprise-grade virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With Red Hat Virtualization, you can manage your entire virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API.

The infrastructure migration is performed with Red Hat CloudForms. CloudForms is a user interface, providing the control and automation required to manage challenging enterprise environments.

The infrastructure migration process has 4 key phases:

* Prerequisites:
** Installing Red Hat Virtualization, Red Hat Virtualization Host, and Red Hat CloudForms.
** Creating and configuring RHV conversion hosts.

* Discovery:
** Discovering your environment.
** Planning your migration.
** Best Practices.

* Planning:
** Creating an infrastructure mapping.
** Creating and running a migration plan.

* Migration:
** Migration workflow.
** Troubleshooting.
