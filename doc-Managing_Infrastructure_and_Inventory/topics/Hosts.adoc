== Comparing Hosts

{product-title} allows you to compare hosts and check operating systems, host software and version information, and hardware.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Hosts].
. Check the hosts to compare.
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2148.png[] (*Compare selected Hosts*).
  The comparison displays in a default expanded view, which lists a limited set of properties.
. To remove a host from the comparison, click  image:1861.png[] (*Remove this Host from the comparison*) at the bottom of the column.
. To go to a compressed view, click  image:2024.png[] (*Compressed View*).
  To return to an expanded view, click  image:2023.png[] (*Expanded View*).
. To limit the mode of the view, there are two buttons in the taskbar.
+
* Click  image:2022.png[] (*Details Mode*) to see all details for an attribute.
* Click  image:2025.png[] (*Exists Mode*) to limit the view to if an attribute exists compared to the base or not.
  This only applies to attributes that can have a Boolean property.
  For example, a user account exists or does not exist, or a piece of hardware that does or does not exist.

. To change the base host that compare to the other hosts, click its label at the top of its column.
. To go to the summary screen for a host, click its virtual thumbnail or icon.
