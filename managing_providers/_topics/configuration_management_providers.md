# Configuration Management Providers

In {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, a configuration management provider is a
systems management product that you can add to a {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
appliance to manage the lifecycle of your resources. Configuration
management providers are useful for uniformly applying changes and
updates across providers, and for recording and reporting status and
change activity. They can also help eliminate the confusion and error
brought about by the existence of different providers.

This chapter describes the different types of configuration management
providers available to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, and how to manage them.
Configuration management providers must be added individually to
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}.
