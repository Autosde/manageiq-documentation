[[Planning_the_migration]]
= Planning the migration

During the planning phase, formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000{nbsp}virtual machines, with 200{nbsp}TB of data, in less than 6 months".

The following can help you plan the steps toward that goal:

* Questions about resources, guest operating systems, and migration duration (xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration[])
* Recommendations for minimizing the impact of the migration on your environment (xref:Recommendations_for_migration[])
