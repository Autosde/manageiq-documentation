= Migrating the infrastructure

Migrating the infrastructure involves the following key tasks:

. Mapping the resources of your source environment to your target environment (xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping[])

. Check the following prerequisites to see whether they apply to your migration:

.. Creating a CSV file (xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[])
* Mandatory, if you are migrating source virtual machines that have been migrated in the past
* Optional, but recommended, for large migrations

.. Creating a `RHEL premigration` Ansible playbook (xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[])
* Mandatory, if you are migrating source virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system

.. Adding Ansible playbooks to CloudForms (xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[])
* Mandatory, if you are creating a `RHEL premigration` Ansible playbook
* Optional, for automated premigration and postmigration tasks

. Creating a migration plan (xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[])
. Running a migration plan (xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[])

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.
