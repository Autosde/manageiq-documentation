= Migrating the infrastructure

Migrating the infrastructure involves the following key tasks:

. xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping[], to map the resources of your source environment to your target environment

. Checking whether the following options are relevant for your migration:

* xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[], if you are migrating source virtual machines that have been migrated in the past. A CSV file is optional, but recommended, for large migrations.

* xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[], if you are migrating source virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system

* xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[], if you are using Ansible playbooks, such as the `RHEL premigration` playbook, to automate premigration and postmigration tasks

. xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[]
