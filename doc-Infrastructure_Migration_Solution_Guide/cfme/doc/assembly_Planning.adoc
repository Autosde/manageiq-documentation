= Planning the migration

During the planning phase, you can formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months."

To plan your migration, you can check the following:

* xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration[Questions to ask before migration], so that you can estimate the resources the migration requires

* xref:Migration_example[Migration example] to help estimate the time duration of your migration

* xref:Recommendations_for_migration[Recommendations for migration], so that the process fits your needs and schedule
