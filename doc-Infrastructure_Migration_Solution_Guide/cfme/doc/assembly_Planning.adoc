[[Planning_the_migration]]
= Planning the migration

During the planning phase, formulate a specific migration goal:

Example: "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months."

See the xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration[planning questions] for guidance in allocating resources.

A xref:Migration_example[migration example] is provided so that you can estimate the time duration of the migration.

xref:Recommendations_for_migration[Recommendations for migration] help you tailor the migration to fit your needs and schedule.
