[[Planning]]
= Planning Your Migration

During the planning phase, you will formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months."

The xref:Planning_questions[planning questions] and xref:Best_practices_for_migration[best practices] provide guidance for creating a migration strategy that is suitable for your particular environment.

The xref:Migration_example[migration example] can help you estimate the time duration of the migration.
