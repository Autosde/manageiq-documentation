The planning phase enables you to formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000 virtual machines, with 200 TB of data, in less than 6 months." You must determine your migration requirements and follow the best practices.

The power state of the migrated virtual machines is preserved: a virtual machine that is powered on or off before migration will be in the same power state after migration.
