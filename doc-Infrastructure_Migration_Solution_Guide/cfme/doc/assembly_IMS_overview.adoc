= Infrastructure Migration Solution overview

The Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to the following target environments:

* Red Hat Virtualization 4.3
+
Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) is a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. (For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization[Red Hat Virtualization documentation].)

* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14
+
OpenStack Platform enables you to create a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. (For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform[Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation].)

The migration process is performed with CloudForms, a user interface for managing the infrastructure. (For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms documentation].)
