If errors occur for reasons unrelated to the infrastructure mapping or migration plan, you can xref:Retrying_a_Migration_Plan[retry the migration plan].

If the cause of the failed migration is not clear, see xref:Logs[] and xref:Common_issues_and_mistakes[].

[[Retrying_a_Migration_Plan]]
== Retrying a Migration Plan

If one or more virtual machines in a migration plan fails to migrate, the migration plan's status is `Failed`. You can retry a migration plan:

. Click the migration plan to go to the details page to identify the virtual machines that failed to migrate.
. Delete the target virtual machines that were created during the failed migration to avoid name conflicts.
. Delete the target disks that were created during the failed migration to free up space.
. Click menu:Compute[Migration], select `Failed Migrations`, select the failed migration plan, and click `Retry`.

[[Logs]]
== Logs

If a migration plan fails and you are not sure of the cause, check the following logs:

* CloudForms migration log: `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log`
* Conversion host logs: `/var/log/vdsm/import/`
* Virtual machine migration log: Click menu:Compute[Migrate], click the migration plan name, and click `Download Log`.

. Create and run a new migration plan, using a xref:CSV_file[CSV file] to import the virtual machines.

[[Common_issues_and_mistakes]]
== Common Issues and Mistakes

[[Infrastructure_mapping_missing_resources]]
Infrastructure mapping is missing datastores or clusters::
If you create an infrastructure mapping and subsequently add or remove providers or provider objects, the infrastructure mapping displays *Datastores missing* or *Clusters missing* error messages because the object IDs of the providers and their objects have changed. You must delete the infrastructure mapping and re-create it.

[[Infrastructure_mapping_missing_networks]]
Infrastructure mapping is missing networks::
If the infrastructure mapping displays a *Networks missing* error message, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/#authenticating_rhv_hosts[authenticate the RHV conversion hosts] and create a new infrastructure mapping.

Incorrect attributes in the virtual machine CSV import file::
Create a new migration plan, import the correct CSV file, and run the migration plan.

Migration fails immediately::
If a migration fails immediately, before the progress bar is displayed, this is often caused by a configuration error in the environment. Check the *automation.log* file on the CloudForms appliance.

Migration fails during virtual machine conversion::
If a migration fails when the virtual machines are being converted (the progress bar updates), click the migration plan to go to the details page, and download the conversion log for the the virtual machine(s) that failed to migrate.

[[SSH_transformation_fails]]
SSH transformation fails::
If you are using SSSD with single sign-on for RHV, SSH fails for the `vdsm` account.
+
Reinstall `ipa-client` without configuring the OpenSSH client:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----

Changing the configuration file is not recommended because it is restored during upgrades. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[BZ#1544379] for details.
