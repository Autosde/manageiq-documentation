If a migration failure was caused by external factors, such as network disruption, you can retry the migration (xref:Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan[]).

To troubleshoot migration errors:

* Check the migration logs (xref:Migration_logs[])

* Check the following common issues and mistakes:

** Infrastructure mapping errors (xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[])
** Migration plan errors (xref:Migration_plan_errors[])
** Virtual machine migration errors (xref:Virtual_machine_migration_errors[])

See xref:Known_issues[] for information about obtaining critical updates and about issues that will be addressed in a future release.
