= Infrastructure Migration Solution Overview

Red Hat's Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization or to Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization] (RHV) is an enterprise-grade virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With Red Hat Virtualization, you can manage your entire virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] provides the foundation to build a private or public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It offers a massively scalable, fault-tolerant platform for the development of cloud-enabled workloads.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms] provides the user interface required to manage challenging enterprise environments.

Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.

.IMS Phases

The Infrastructure Migration Solution has 4 key phases:

. Planning the migration:

* Consult the xref:Planning_questions[planning questions] to ensure that you have sufficient resources for the migration.
* Follow xref:Best_practices_for_migration[best practices] to minimize the impact on your users. You may choose to schedule the migration in phases or to create groups of virtual machines that should migrate together.

. Preparing the migration environment:

* xref:Preparing_the_vmware_source_environment[Prepare the VMware environment] for migration.
* Prepare the xref:Preparing_the_rhv_target_environment[Red Hat Virtualization] or xref:Preparing_the_osp_target_environment[OpenStack Platform] environment as the migration target.
* Install and configure CloudForms to manage the infrastructure providers and resources.
* Create and configure xref:Preparing_the_rhv_conversion_hosts[RHV conversion hosts] or OpenStack Platform conversion instances.
// To do: insert xref:[]

. Migrating the infrastructure:

* xref:Creating_an_Infrastructure_Mapping[Map] your source environment to the target environment.
* Create and run a xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plan].

. Verifying the migration:

* Check the completed migration plan for successfully migrated virtual machines.
* If errors appear, see xref:Troubleshooting[].
