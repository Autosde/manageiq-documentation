= Infrastructure Migration Solution overview

Red Hat's Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization or to Red Hat OpenStack Platform:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization] (RHV) is a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] enables you to build a private or public cloud on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. OpenStack Platform is scaleable and fault-tolerant.

The actual migration process is performed in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms], a user interface for managing the infrastructure. CloudForms enables you to map your source and target environments and to create and run a migration plan.

The Infrastructure Migration Solution has 3 key phases:
