= Infrastructure Migration Solution Overview

Red Hat's Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization] (RHV) is an enterprise-grade virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With Red Hat Virtualization, you can manage your entire virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. The user interface, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms] (CF),  provides the control and automation required to manage challenging enterprise environments.

Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.

.Phases

The infrastructure migration process has 4 key phases:

. Preparation:
** xref:Preparing_the_source_and_target_environments[Setting up your environment]
** xref:Preparing_the_rhv_conversion_hosts[Creating and configuring the conversion host(s)]

. Planning:
** xref:Determining_your_migration_requirements[Determining your migration requirements]
** Following xref:Best_practices[best practices]

. Migration:
** xref:Creating_an_Infrastructure_Mapping[Mapping] your source environment to the target environment
** Performing the xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration]

. Verification:
