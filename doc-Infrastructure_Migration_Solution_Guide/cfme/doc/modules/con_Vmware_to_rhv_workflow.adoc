= VMware to Red Hat Virtualization Workflow

This workflow describes the process of migrating  from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization.

. After creating an infrastructure mapping and a migration plan, you run the migration plan.

. CloudForms locates the virtual machines to be migrated based on the infrastructure mapping.

. The ESXi host fingerprint is captured for authentication during the virtual machine conversion process, if VDDK transformation is used.

. Using the Red Hat Virtualization attributes defined for the target environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the RHV conversion hosts.

. A RHV conversion host connects to the source datastore through the ESXi host, using `virt-v2v-wrapper`, and streams the disks to be converted to the target data storage domain, using `virt-v2v`.

. The virtual machine is created in the Red Hat Virtualization environment. The target virtual machine uses the source virtual machine’s metadata to maintain the virtual machine’s attributes (tags, power state, MAC address, CPU count, memory, disks, and virtual machine name) after migration.
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the source virtual machine’s power state before migration, the virtual machine is either left powered off or is powered on after migration to Red Hat Virtualization.
====
. The converted disks are attached to the target virtual machine.

The migration process is complete and its status is displayed in CloudForms.
