= Retrying a failed migration plan

If a migration plan fails because of external factors, you can retry the migration:

. Delete newly created target virtual machines or instances, if any, to avoid name conflicts with the migrating VMware virtual machines.
. Delete newly created disks in the target datastore to free up space.
. OpenStack Platform only: Delete newly created network ports of failed instances.
. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].
. Click `Migration Plans Complete`.
. Click the *Retry* button beside the failed migration plan.
