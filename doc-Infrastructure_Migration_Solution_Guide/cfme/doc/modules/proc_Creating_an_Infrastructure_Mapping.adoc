====
Before creating an infrastructure mapping, you must link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/#authenticating_rhv_hosts[authenticate the RHV conversion hosts]. Otherwise, the network will be missing in the  infrastructure mapping.
====

. Enter the name of your mapping and click *Next*.
. Select a source cluster and a target cluster.

[NOTE]
====
A target cluster that does not contain a conversion host is marked with a warning icon (&#65279;image:warning.png[height=15px]&#65279;), which appears after a few seconds' delay for polling the clusters and refreshing the UI.
