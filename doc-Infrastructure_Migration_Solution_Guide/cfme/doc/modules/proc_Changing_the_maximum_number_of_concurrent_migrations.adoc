.(Optional) Changing the maximum number of concurrent migrations

The default number of concurrent migrations is `10` for conversion hosts and `10` for a provider. You can change these limits to control the impact of the migration process on your infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The maximum number of concurrent virtual machine migrations per conversion host is `20` for VDDK and `?` for SSH.

PLACEHOLDER: Confirm maximum numbers for VDDK and SSH.
====

// â€‹Fabien: We should ask QE and Rich Jones what the limits are for both VDDK and SSH. I thought we worked around these limits by using direct connection to ESXi...

The provider's limit has priority over the conversion hosts' limits. For example, if a provider's limit is set to `20` and five conversion hosts' limits are set to `3`, the maximum number of concurrent migrations is `20`, not `15`.

*Changing the limit for conversion hosts*

An increase affects all migration plans immediately. Virtual machines that are queued to migrate will migrate in greater numbers.

A decrease affects future migration plans. Migration plans that are in progress will continue to use the limit that was set when the plan was created.

To change the limit for all conversion hosts, click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Settings] in CloudForms and select the new limit.

To change the limit for a specific conversion host, enter the following command on the CloudForms machine:
