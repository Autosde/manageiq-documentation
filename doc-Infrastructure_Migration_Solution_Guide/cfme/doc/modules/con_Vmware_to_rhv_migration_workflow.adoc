= VMware to Red Hat Virtualization migration workflow

This workflow describes the process of migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization after creating the infrastructure mapping and the migration plan.

image:circle_step_numbers/2.png[25,25] CloudForms uses the migration plan to locate the VMware virtual machines to be migrated.

image:circle_step_numbers/3.png[25,25] If VDDK transformation is used, the ESXi host fingerprint is captured for authentication during the virtual machine conversion process.

image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] Using the attributes defined for the RHV environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the conversion hosts.

image:circle_step_numbers/5.png[25,25] The RHV conversion host connects to the VMware datastore through the ESXi host with `virt-v2v-wrapper`, streams the disks to be converted to the RHV data storage domain with `virt-v2v`, and converts the disks.

image:circle_step_numbers/6.png[25,25] The virtual machine is created in the RHV environment. The RHV virtual machine uses the VMware virtual machine’s metadata to maintain the virtual machine’s attributes (tags, power state, MAC address, CPU count, memory, disks, and virtual machine name) after migration.

image:circle_step_numbers/7.png[25,25] The converted disks are attached to the RHV virtual machine. The RHV virtual machine's power state is identical to the VMware's virtual machine's premigration state.

The migration process is complete and the migration plan's status is displayed in CloudForms.
