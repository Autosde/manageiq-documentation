= Creating a migration plan

Create a migration plan with an infrastructure mapping, adding the source virtual machines. You can choose to run the migration plan immediately or in the future.

[NOTE]
====
For large migrations, it is faster to add the virtual machines with a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] than to select them individually.

If your source virtual machines that have been migrated previously, a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] is mandatory.
