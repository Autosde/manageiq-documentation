= Preparing the VMware Environment

Prepare the VMware source environment for migration:

. Extend the VMware network to the target environment.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The network configuration must not be changed in any way during the migration. IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configurations must be the same, before and after migration, because the conversion process preserves the source virtual machine MAC addresses.
====

. Check that no VMware virtual machine has the same name as a virtual machine that already exists in the target environment. A name conflict will cause the migration to fail.

. Unmount ISO images from the VMware virtual machines. A virtual machine with an attached ISO image will cause the migration to fail.
