= Preparing the source environment

Prepare the source environment's network and virtual machines for migration.

.Preparing the source network

* Extend the source network to the target environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The network configuration must not be changed in any way during the migration.

Ensure that IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configurations are not changed before or after migration, because the conversion process preserves the source virtual machine MAC addresses.
====

.Preparing the source virtual machines

. Unmount mounted ISO/CDROM disks.

. Check that attached disks are not encrypted.

. Check that each NIC has no more than one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.

. Install VMware Tools to capture IP addresses (see link:https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html[Installing VMware Tools] for instructions).

. Check that source virtual machine names contain only upper- or lower-case letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), hyphens (`-`), or periods (`.`). *Special characters and spaces are not permitted.*

. Red Hat Virtualization only: Check that source virtual machine names do not duplicate the names of existing RHV virtual machines.

You are ready to prepare the target environment.
