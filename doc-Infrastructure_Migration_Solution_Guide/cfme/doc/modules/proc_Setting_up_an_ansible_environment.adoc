= Setting up an Ansible environment for CloudForms

Create an Ansible environment that is accessible to CloudForms, with credentials and playbooks. A playbook is an Ansible service catalog item and is selected when you create the migration plan.

You can use Ansible playbooks to perform automated tasks, for example, removing web servers from a load-balancing pool before migration and adding them back to the pool after migration.

.Procedure

The CloudForms inventory requires a minimum of one Ansible repository, one playbook, and one set of credentials.
