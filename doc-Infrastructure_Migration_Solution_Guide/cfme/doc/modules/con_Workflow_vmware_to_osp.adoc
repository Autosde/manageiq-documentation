= Workflow: Migrating to OpenStack

This workflow occurs when you migrate your infrastructure from VMware to OpenStack.

. After creating an infrastructure mapping and a migration plan, you run the migration plan.

. CloudForms locates the virtual machines to be migrated based on the infrastructure mapping.

. The ESXi host fingerprint is captured for authentication during the virtual machine conversion process.

. Using the OpenStack migration attributes defined for the target environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the OpenStack conversion appliances. The conversion appliances are OSP instances with virt-v2v, virt-v2v-wrapper and nbdkit installed.

. The OpenStack conversion appliance connects to the source datastore, using `virt-v2v-wrapper.py`, and streams the disk(s) to be converted to the target block storage on Ceph, using `virt-v2v`. Volumes are created in the block storage, attached to the conversion appliance, and the source disk(s) are converted.

. After the disk(s) are converted, the volumes are detached from the conversion appliance. CloudForms instructs the `virt-v2v` wrapper to create a target instance in OpenStack with `virt-v2v`. The target instance uses the source virtual machineâ€™s metadata to map to a flavor, predefined security group, and defined network(s), based on the infrastructure mapping and migration plan settings.

. During instance creation, the disk(s) mapped in block storage are attached to the instance, and the instance is powered on.

The virtual machine migration is complete and its status is displayed in CloudForms.
