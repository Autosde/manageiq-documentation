[[Creating_a_Migration_Plan]]
= Creating and Running a Migration Plan

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* If you are migrating a large number of virtual machines or you are re-migrating virtual machines after a failed migration, create a CSV file [[CSV_file]]containing a list of source virtual machines to migrate.
+
The CSV file specifies the virtual machine names (mandatory) and providers (optional, for differentiating virtual machines with identical names), in the following format:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
Name, Provider
_vm01_, _vSphere3_
_vm02_, _vSphere3_
_vm03_, _vSphere3_
...
----

* Check the target datastore to ensure that there are no virtual machines with the same name as a source virtual machine. A name conflict will cause the migration to fail.

* Unmount any ISO images that are mounted on source virtual machines. A virtual machine with an attached ISO image will cause the migration to fail.

* If you are automating pre- and post-migration tasks with Ansible, the Ansible service catalog item must be created first. See xref:Advanced_migration_option-_automating_pre-_and_post-migration_tasks_with_ansible[].

If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, you can use the migration plan to discover the virtual machines. The migration plan displays a list, from which you manually select the virtual machines to migrate.

== Procedure

. Go to menu:Compute[Migration] and click *Create Migration Plan*.

. Select the infrastructure mapping from the drop-down list.

. Enter the name of your migration plan.

. Discover the virtual machines:

* If you are using the migration plan to discover the virtual machines automatically:

.. Select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping*.
.. Click *Next*.

* If you are importing a CSV file:

.. (Optional) To validate your infrastructure mapping, select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*. If your virtual machines appear in the list, the infrastructure mapping is correct. Click *Back*.
.. Select *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated* and click *Next*.
.. Click *Import*, browse to the CSV file, and click *Open*.

. Select the virtual machines to migrate and click *Next* to go to *Advanced Options*.

+
Select an Ansible playbook service catalog item if you are automating pre- or post-migration tasks.

. Select *Start Migration Immediately* and click *Create*.

. Click *Close*. The migration plan may take some time to complete. *In Progress Plans*, the amount of data being transferred, the number of virtual machines being migrated, and the elapsed time are displayed. To view the migration progress of individual virtual machines, click the migration plan to go to the migration plan details.
+
When the migration is complete, the migration plan is displayed under *Completed Migrations*, with the number of successfully migrated virtual machines. A *Retry* option enables you to re-migrate any virtual machines in this plan that failed to migrate. See xref:Retrying_a_Migration_Plan[Retrying a Migration Plan].

[NOTE]
====
During migration, the counter displaying the migration plan progress (in menu:Compute[Migration]) may be a few seconds ahead of the counter that appears in the migration plan details (menu:Compute[Migration>__Migration Plan__]). This is because the migration plan counter displays the total time to run the migration plan, while the migration plan details counter displays the time to migrate the virtual machines.
