The infrastructure migration involves the following key tasks:

* Creating a xref:CSV_file[CSV file] to import virtual machines for large migrations or for remigrating
* Setting up an xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Ansible environment] to automate pre- and post-migration tasks

.Creating a CSV file to import virtual machines

If you are migrating a large number of virtual machines or are xref:Retrying_and_remigrating[remigrating] virtual machines, you must create a CSV file to import the source virtual machines into the migration plan.

[NOTE]
====
If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, you do not need to create a CSV file. The migration plan can discover and display a list from which you manually select the virtual machines to migrate.
====

The CSV file contains the virtual machine names (mandatory) and providers (optional, to differentiate virtual machines with identical names) in the following format:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
Name, Provider
_vm01_, _vSphere3_
_vm02_, _vSphere3_
_vm03_, _vSphere3_
...
----

[[Setting_up_an_ansible_environment]]
.Setting up an Ansible environment for automated tasks

If you want to run automated pre- and post-migration tasks, such as removing web servers from a load-balancing pool before migration and returning them to the pool after migration, you must first set up the Ansible environment:

. Configure an link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#ansible-inside[Ansible repository and credentials].

. Create a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_hosts/#creating-a-catalog-bundle[catalog bundle].

. Create an link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_hosts/#create-playbook-service-catalog-item[Ansible service catalog item].

== Procedure[[Creating_migration_plan]]

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].

. Click *Create Migration Plan*.

. In the *General* screen, select the infrastructure mapping from the drop-down list. If you select an OpenStack Platform infrastructure mapping, the *Migration Plan Wizard* displays an additional screen, *Instance Properties*, after the *VM* screen.

. Enter the name of your migration plan and a description (optional).

. Discover the source virtual machines:

* If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*.
+
.Discovered virtual machines

* If you are importing a CSV file:

.. (Optional) You can validate your infrastructure mapping. Select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*. If your virtual machines appear in the list, the infrastructure mapping is correct. Click *Back*.
.. Select *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated* and click *Next*.
.. Click *Import*, browse to the CSV file, and click *Open*.

* If you cannot import or discover the source virtual machines, see xref:Migration_plan_errors[Migration plan errors].

. In the *VM* screen, select the virtual machines to migrate and click *Next*.

. OpenStack Platform only: In the *Instance Properties* screen, click the pencil icon to edit the network or flavor of each selected virtual machine.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a flavor is too small for the source virtual machine, it is marked with an asterisk (`*`).
====
+
When you have finished editing the virtual machines, click *Next*.

. [[Automating_pre_and_post_migration_tasks_with_ansible]]In the *Advanced Options* screen, you can select pre- and post-migration playbook services, which you have already created, and the virtual machines on which they should run. See xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Setting up an Ansible environment for automated tasks].

[[Advanced_options_screen]]

Click *Next*.

. In the *Schedule* screen, select *Save migration plan to run later* or *Start Migration Immediately* and click *Create*. The status of the migration plan is displayed in the *Results* screen:
+
* If you select *Save migration plan to run later*, the migration plan is saved in *Migration Plans Not Started*.[[Running_migration_plan]]
+
To schedule the migration plan, click the *Schedule* button, select a date and time, and click *Schedule*. The plan's status is *Migration Scheduled* with the date and time.
+
[NOTE]
====
To run a scheduled plan immediately, click *Migrate*.

To edit or delete a schedule or plan, click the *More Actions* icon.
====

* If you select *Start Migration Immediately*, the migration plan runs immediately.
+
The migration plan may take some time to complete. The migration plan displays progress bars showing the amount of data being transferred, the number of virtual machines being migrated, and the elapsed time.
+
To view the migration progress of individual virtual machines, click *Migration Plans in Progress* and click the migration plan name to display the migration plan details.
+
[NOTE]
====
The counter displaying the migration plan progress in menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans] may be a few seconds ahead of the counter that appears in the migration plan details. This is because the migration plans counter displays the total time for running a migration plan, while the migration plan details counter displays the time for migrating the virtual machines.
====

. When the migration plan has finished, click *Migration Plans Complete* to view the status of the migration plan. The completed migration plan shows successfully migrated virtual machines.
+
A `Denied State` error indicates a problem with the conversion hosts (see xref:Denied_state_error[Denied state error] for more information).
+
If a virtual machine fails to migrate, see xref:Virtual_machine_migration_failure[Virtual machine migration failure].
