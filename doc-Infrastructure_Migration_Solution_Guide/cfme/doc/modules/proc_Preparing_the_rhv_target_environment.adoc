= Preparing the Red Hat Virtualization environment

To prepare the Red Hat Virtualization environment for migration:

. Ensure that the datastore has sufficient space for the virtual machines you are migrating.

. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#part-Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager[Red Hat Virtualization Manager] 4.2.7 or later.

. Install   link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Installing_RHVH[Red Hat Virtualization Hosts] 4.2.7 or later or  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts[Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts] 7.6 or later.

. Enable the following https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[ports] in the conversion host network:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

. Attach  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#chap-Storage[data and ISO storage domains] to the data center.
