= Advanced Migration Option: Automating Pre- and Post-Migration Tasks with Ansible

Certain tasks may need to be performed before or after a virtual machine is migrated, for example, removing web server virtual machines from a load-balancing pool before migration and adding them back to the pool after migration. When creating a migration plan, you can specify an Ansible service catalog item to run before or after the migration of each virtual machine within the plan.
