= Retrying a migration

When virtual machines fail to migrate, the migration plan's status is `Failed`. If the cause of the failed migration was external (for example, network disruption) and the virtual machines have not been migrated in the past, clean the target environment and retry the migration plan:

.Procedure

. Delete newly created target virtual machines or instances to avoid name conflicts with source virtual machines.
. Delete newly created disks in the target datastore to free up space.
. OpenStack Platform only: Delete newly created network ports of failed instances.
. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Plans].
. Click `Migration Plans Complete`.
. Click the `Retry` button beside the failed migration plan.
