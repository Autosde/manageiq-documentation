= Recommendations for planning a migration

The following recommendations can facilitate the migration planning.

.Dividing the migration

* Create migration groups, so that you are not migrating all of your virtual machines at the same time. The following questions provide guidelines:

** How are the virtual machines grouped now?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** What workloads should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

* Keep linked applications together, so that they migrate at the same time.

.Scheduling the migration

* Schedule your migration carefully, to minimize the impact on your users.
* Prepare your users for downtime.
* Stagger the migration schedules.
* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.
* Plan for redundancy.

.Checking resources

* Ensure that you have sufficient space for the migration. The migration process does not delete the original virtual machines.
* Minimize the impact on your environment by creating multiple migration plans to control and throttle the migration process.
* Perform test migrations with different xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[maximum numbers of concurrent migrations per conversion host] to assess the capabilities of your environment's infrastructure.
