= Preparing Red Hat OpenStack Platform Environment

Prepare the OpenStack Platform environment for migration:

. Ensure that the datastore has sufficient space for the virtual machines you are migrating.

. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] 10 or later.

// To do - sec group for conversionapp or CF?
. Create a security group for the OpenStack Platform conversion appliance and enable the following https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[ports]:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

. Check that no source virtual machine has the same name as a virtual machine in the target environment. A name conflict will cause the migration to fail.

. Unmount ISO images from source virtual machines. A virtual machine with an attached ISO image will cause the migration to fail.

. Create and configure the OpenStack Platform conversion appliances.
