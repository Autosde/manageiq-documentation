. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance (rather than power-saving), according to the vendor's recommendations, and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] 13 or later.

. Create link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[provider networks] for the OpenStack Platform instances to ensure that the source IP addresses are preserved.

. Create a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#create_a_project[project] for the conversion hosts and whatever destination projects you require for the OpenStack Platform instances.

. Ensure that the `admin` user has link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#edit_a_project[`member` and `admin` roles] in the conversion and destination projects.

. Set at least one link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volumes-advanced-vol-type[`volume type`] for the OpenStack Platform block storage. Otherwise, CloudForms cannot detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the OpenStack Platform storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.

. Configure security groups:

* A security group for the conversion hosts and CloudForms must have port 22 (SSH) enabled.
* A security group for CloudForms must have port 443 (HTTPS) enabled.

[NOTE]
====
Outbound traffic is enabled by default. If you have changed this setting, enable ports 902 (CloudForms to VMware) and 5480 (`virt-v2v` to vCenter).
====

. Create flavors suitable for the virtual machines that you are migrating. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms tries to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_openstack_platform/[Red Hat CloudForms] 4.7 or later.

. Add the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[VMware] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#adding_an_openstack_infrastructure_provider[OpenStack Platform] environments as providers in CloudForms.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not remove or change a provider before, during, or after migration because it has negative effects on the CloudForms migration objects.
====

. Ensure that the user configured in CloudForms for the OpenStack Platform provider has `admin` privileges for the target projects.
