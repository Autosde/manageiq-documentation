= Preparing the Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment

.Prerequisite

Check the software compatibility requirements in xref:Software_compatibility_requirements[].

.Procedure

. Ensure that the OpenStack Platform storage backends have sufficient space for the virtual machines you are migrating.

. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance (rather than power-saving), according to the vendor's recommendations, and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] 13 or later.

. Create link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[provider networks] for the OpenStack Platform instances to ensure that the VMware IP addresses are preserved.

. Ensure that the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#edit_a_project[`admin` user has `member` and `admin` roles] in the conversion and destination projects.

. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volumes-advanced-vol-type[Set at least one `volume type`] for the OpenStack Platform block storage. Otherwise, CloudForms will not detect the storage during infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the user configured in CloudForms for the OpenStack Platform provider has `admin` privileges on the target projects.

. Configure security groups:
* A security group for the conversion hosts and CloudForms must have port 22 (SSH) enabled.
* A security group for CloudForms must have port 443 (HTTPS) enabled.

[NOTE]
====
Outbound traffic is enabled by default. If you have changed this setting, enable ports 902 (CloudForms to VMware) and 5480 (`virt-v2v` to vCenter).
====

. Create flavors suitable for the virtual machines that you are migrating. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each VMware virtual machine to an existing flavor.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_openstack_platform/[Red Hat CloudForms] 4.7 or later.

. Add the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[VMware] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#adding_an_openstack_infrastructure_provider[OpenStack Platform] environments as providers in CloudForms.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not remove or change a provider before, during, or after migration because it will have negative effects on the CloudForms migration objects.
