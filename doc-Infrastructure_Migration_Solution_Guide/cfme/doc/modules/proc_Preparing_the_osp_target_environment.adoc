= Preparing Red Hat OpenStack platform environment

Prepare the OpenStack Platform environment for migration:

. TBD: Specific recommendations for OpenStack Platform deployment
// To do
. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the virtual machines you are migrating.

. Set the BIOS settings of the physical hosts for optimal performance, rather than power-saving, according to the vendor's recommendations and disable the C1E halt state, if applicable.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] 10 or later.

. Create a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[provider network] for the target instances, to ensure that the IP addresses of the source virtual machines are preserved.

. Create a custom security group for the conversion appliances and the CloudForms instance, enabling the following https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[ports]:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, OpenStack Platform, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - `virt-v2v` to vCenter

. Create flavors suitable for the virtual machines that you are migrating. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map the source virtual machine to an existing flavor.

. Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_openstack_platform/[Red Hat CloudForms] 4.7.0 or later.

. Add the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[VMware] and  link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/#adding_an_openstack_infrastructure_provider[OpenStack Platform] environments to CloudForms.

. Unmount ISO images from source virtual machines. A virtual machine with an attached ISO image will cause the migration to fail.

. Create and configure the xref:Preparing_the_conversion_hosts[conversion hosts].
