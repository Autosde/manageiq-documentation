= Migration plan errors

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_discovered"]
* Virtual machines cannot be discovered:

** Virtual machines being migrated for the first time: Check that the datastores and networks of the source virtual machines have been added to the Infrastructure Mapping.

** Virtual machines have been migrated in the past: Use a CSV file to add the virtual machines to the migration plan (xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[]).

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_added_with_CSV_file"]
* Virtual machines cannot be added to the migration plan with a CSV file: Check the CSV file format and fields  (xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[]). Create a new migration plan with the updated CSV file.

[id="Denied_state_error"]
* `Denied State`: If a migration plan fails immediately and the migration plan displays a *Denied State* error message, check the conversion host configuration in menu:Compute[Migration > Migration Settings]. Cancel the migration plan and retry it (xref:Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan[]).
