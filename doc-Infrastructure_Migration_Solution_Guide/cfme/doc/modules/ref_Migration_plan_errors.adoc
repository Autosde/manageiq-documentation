= Migration plan errors

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_discovered"]
* Virtual machines cannot be discovered. If a migration plan cannot discover source virtual machines that have never been migrated in the past, check that the datastores and networks of the source virtual machines have been added to the Infrastructure Mapping.
+
If a migration plan cannot discover source virtual machines that have been migrated in the past, xref:Remigrating_virtual_machines[re-migrate] the virtual machines. Previously migrated virtual machines cannot be discovered because they are marked as `migrated` in the CloudForms VMDB.

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_added_with_CSV_file"]
* Virtual machines cannot be added to the migration plan with a CSV file. If you cannot add the source virtual machines into a migration plan with a CSV file, check the xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file's format and fields]. Create a new migration plan using the updated CSV file.

[id="Denied_state_error"]
* `Denied State`. If a migration plan fails immediately and the migration plan displays a *Denied State* error message, check that you have xref:Creating_conversion_hosts[created the conversion hosts]. (Red Hat Virtualization only: ensure that you have xref:Enabling_rhv_conversion_hosts_in_cloudforms[authenticated the conversion hosts]). Cancel the migration plan and xref:Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan[retry it].
