The infrastructure mapping maps your source resources to target resources.

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].
. Click *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
. Perform the following procedures in the Infrastructure Mapping wizard:

^|Screen ^|Procedure

|*General*
.<a|. Enter the infrastructure mapping name and (optional) description.
. Select the target provider from the drop-down list.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Compute*
.<a|. Select a source cluster and a target Red Hat Virtualization cluster or OpenStack Platform project.
+
*Red Hat Virtualization only:* A target cluster that does not contain a conversion host displays a warning icon (&#65279;image:warning.png[height=15px]&#65279;). The icon appears after a few seconds' delay for polling the clusters and refreshing the UI.
. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional clusters.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Storage*
.<a|. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
. Select a source datastore and a target Red Hat Virtualization datastore or OpenStack Platform volume type.
+
*OpenStack Platform only:* If the target datastore is missing, see xref:OpenStack_storage_not_detected[Storage not detected] in xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[].
. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional datastores.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Networks*
.<a|. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
. Select one or more source networks and a target network.
+
*OpenStack Platform only:* IMS supports both provider and tenant networks.

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map the networks of additional source clusters.
. Click *Create*.

|*Results*
.<a|Click *Close*. Your infrastructure mapping is saved in menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or remove providers or provider objects from an infrastructure mapping, the mapping will have missing resource errors (see xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[]). You must re-create the infrastructure mapping.

After you have created a successful infrastructure mapping, review the migration plan prerequisites to see whether they apply to your migration (xref:Migration_plan_options[]).
