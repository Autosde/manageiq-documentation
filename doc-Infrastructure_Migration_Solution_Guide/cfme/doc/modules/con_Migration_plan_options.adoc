= Migration plan prerequisites and options[[Migration_plan_prerequisites_and_options]]

The following prerequisites and options may apply to your migration:

* xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[], if the source virtual machines have been migrated in the past. Previously migrated virtual machines cannot be discovered by the migration plan because they are marked as `migrated` in the CloudForms database.

* xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[], to ensure that their IP addresses are accessible after migration

* xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[], if you are using Ansible playbooks, including the `RHEL premigration` playbook, for premigration/postmigration tasks

If these prerequisites and options do not apply, you can xref:Creating_a_migration_plan[create a migration plan].
