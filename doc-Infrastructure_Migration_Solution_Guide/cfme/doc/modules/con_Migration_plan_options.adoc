= Migration plan prerequisites

The migration plan prerequisites apply to the following conditions:

* Migrating previously migrated virtual machines
+
See xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[].

* Migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system
+
See xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[].

* Using Ansible playbooks for premigration/postmigration tasks
+
See xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[].

If these conditions do not apply, you can create a migration plan. See xref:Creating_a_migration_plan[].
