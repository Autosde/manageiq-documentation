= Migration plan options

Check the following options to see whether they apply to your migration:

* xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[], to add them to the migration plan. Previously migrated virtual machines cannot be discovered automatically by the migration plan because they are marked as `migrated` in the CloudForms database.
+
A CSV file is optional, but recommended, for large migrations. Adding virtual machines with a CSV file is faster than manually selecting virtual machines for migration or selecting an OpenStack Platform security group and flavor for each virtual machine.

* xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[], to ensure that their IP addresses are accessible after migration

* xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[], if you are using Ansible playbooks, including the `RHEL premigration` playbook

If you are not using these options, go to xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[].
