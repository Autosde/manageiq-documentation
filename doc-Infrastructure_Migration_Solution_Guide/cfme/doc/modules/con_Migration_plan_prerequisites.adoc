= Migration plan prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to certain migrations:

* CSV file, to add previously migrated virtual machines to the migration plan. The migration plan cannot discover these virtual machines because their status is `migrated` in the CloudForms database. See xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[].

* `RHEL premigration` playbook, for source virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system. The playbook ensures that the IP addresses of these virtual machines are accessible after migration. See xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[] and  xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[].

* Ansible environment that can be accessed by CloudForms, if you are using playbooks to automate tasks before or after migration. See xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[].
