The following prerequisites may apply to your migration plan:

* Creating a CSV file (xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[])
** Mandatory, if you are migrating source virtual machines that have been migrated in the past
** Optional, but recommended, for large migrations

* Creating a `RHEL premigration` Ansible playbook (xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook[])
** Mandatory, if you are migrating source virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system

* Adding Ansible playbooks to CloudForms (xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[])
** Mandatory, if you are creating a `RHEL premigration` Ansible playbook
** Optional, for automated premigration and postmigration tasks

If these prerequisites do not apply, you can create a migration plan (xref:Creating_a_migration_plan[]).
