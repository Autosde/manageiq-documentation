= Migration plan prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to certain migrations:

* xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file], to add previously migrated virtual machines to the migration plan. The migration plan cannot discover these virtual machines automatically because their status is `migrated` in the CloudForms database.
+
Optionally, you can use a CSV file for large migrations.

* xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[Ansible configuration in CloudForms], if you are using playbooks to automate premigration or postmigration tasks

* xref:Rhel_premigration_playbook[`RHEL premigration` playbook for virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system], to ensure that their IP addresses are accessible after migration
