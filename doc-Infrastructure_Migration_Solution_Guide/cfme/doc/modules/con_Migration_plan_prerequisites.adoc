= Migration plan prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to certain migrations:

* xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file], if you are migrating previously migrated virtual machines. Previously migrated virtual machines are added to the migration plan with a CSV file. The migration plan cannot discover these virtual machines automatically because their status is `migrated` in the CloudForms database.

* xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms[Ansible configuration in CloudForms], if you are using Ansible playbooks to automate tasks before or after migration

* xref:Rhel_premigration_playbook[`RHEL premigration` playbook], if you are migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux-based operating system, to ensure that their IP addresses are accessible after migration
