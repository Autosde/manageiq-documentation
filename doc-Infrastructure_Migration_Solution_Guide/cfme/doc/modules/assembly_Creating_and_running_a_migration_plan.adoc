= Creating and running a migration plan

The infrastructure migration involves the following key tasks:

. xref:Premigration_tasks[Premigration tasks]:

* *CSV file:* If you are migrating a large number of virtual machines, you can create a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] to add the virtual machines to the migration plan.
+
If you are migrating virtual machines that have been migrated in the past, you must use a CSV file to add the virtual machines because the migration plan cannot re-discover them.

* *Ansible environment:* If you are using Ansible to automate pre- and post-migration tasks, you must set up an xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Ansible environment].

* *RHEL premigration playbook:* If you are migrating RHEL or other Linux virtual machines, you must set up an xref:Setting_up_an_ansible_environment[Ansible environment] and create a xref:Configuring_the_rhel_premigration_playbook[RHEL premigration playbook].
