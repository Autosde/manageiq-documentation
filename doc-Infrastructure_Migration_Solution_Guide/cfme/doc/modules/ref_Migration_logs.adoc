= Checking migration logs

You can check the migration logs and the CloudForms automation log for errors.

.Downloading the migration logs

. In CloudForms, click menu:Compute[Migration Plans > Migration Plans Complete].
. Click a migration plan name to go to the details view.
. Click *Download Log* of a virtual machine and select a log from the dropdown list:

* *Premigration log:* This option only appears if a premigration playbook is used.
* *Migration log:* Debug log of `virt-v2v`. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details.
* *Virt-v2v-wrapper log:* Log of `virt-v2v-wrapper`, the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting.
* *Postmigration log:* This option only appears if a postmigration playbook is used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both the Migration log (`virt-v2v`) and the `virt-v2v-wrapper` log are required for bug analysis. If you open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support call], you should provide both logs.
