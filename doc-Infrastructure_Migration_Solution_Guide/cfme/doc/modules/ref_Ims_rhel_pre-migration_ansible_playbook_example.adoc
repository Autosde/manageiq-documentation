= RHEL pre-migration Ansible playbook example

You can create an Ansible playbook to automate tasks on the virtual machines before and after migration and add them to your migration plan. This playbook performs the following tasks to configure a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine:

* Preserving the static IP address configuration
* Installing the Red Hat Virtualization guest agent

This example registers a virtual machine with a Satellite 6 server and enables the `rhel-7-server-rpms` repository. If no variables are provided, the playbook assumes that the repositories are already configured and installs the guest agent while maintaining the static IP address.
