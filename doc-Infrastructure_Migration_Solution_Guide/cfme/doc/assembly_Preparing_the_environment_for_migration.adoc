= Preparing the environment for migration

Preparing the environment for migration involves the following key steps:

. Preparing the VMware environment (xref:Preparing_the_vmware_source_environment[])
. Preparing your target environment:

** Red Hat Virtualization (xref:Preparing_the_rhv_target_environment[])
** OpenStack Platform (xref:Preparing_the_osp_target_environment[])

. Configuring the conversion hosts (xref:Configuring_the_conversion_hosts[])

You can change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers for better performance and control of the migration process (xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[]).
