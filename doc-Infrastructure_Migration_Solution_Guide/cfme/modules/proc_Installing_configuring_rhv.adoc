= Installing and configuring Red Hat Virtualization

You must install and configure Red Hat Virtualization.

[NOTE]
====
Some of these hosts will be deployed as conversion hosts. The number of conversion hosts depends on your migration size and infrastructure capabilities.

[NOTE]
====
IMS only supports shared storage, such as NFS, iSCSI, or FCP. Local storage is not supported.

Although the ISO storage domain has been deprecated, it is required for migration.

The VirtIO file name must include the version number: +virtio-win-_version_.iso+. The guest tools are required for migrating Windows virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Red Hat Virtualization MAC address pool range overlaps the VMware MAC address range, you must ensure that the MAC addresses of the migrating virtual machines do not duplicate those of existing virtual machines. Otherwise, the migration will fail.

If you do not create a MAC address pool, the migrated virtual machines will not have MAC addresses in the same range as virtual machines created in Red Hat Virtualization.
