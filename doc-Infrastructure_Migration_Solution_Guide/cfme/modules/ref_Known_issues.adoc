* BZ#1791802: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791802[virt-v2v does not install QEMU-GA on RHEL 8 virtual machine]. In the current release, the QEMU guest agent is not installed on a migrated RHEL 8 virtual machine. As a result, the virtual machine's IP address is not reported in the Red Hat Virtualization inventory. A post-migration playbook inventory will contain only `localhost`. Therefore, you should not associate a post-migration playbook with RHEL 8 virtual machines in a migration plan. This bug will be resolved by RHEL-AV 8.2.0, to be released in May 2020.

// Possible post-migration task for RHEL 8:
// ----
// ---
// - name: Install qemu-guest-agent package
//   yum:
//     name: qemu-guest-agent
//     state: present
//   when: ansible_distribution == "RedHat" and ansible_distribution_major_version >= "8"
// ----

* BZ#1726939: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1726939[Run the preflight check of migration task before waiting for a conversion host]. Currently, the preflight check that monitors the migration is performed after a conversion host is assigned to the task. As a result, the total volume of the Datastores reported in *Migration Plans In Progress* reflects the total volume of the virtual machines that are currently migrating, not the total volume of the migration plan. When all the virtual machines have started to migrate, the correct value of the total volume is displayed.
