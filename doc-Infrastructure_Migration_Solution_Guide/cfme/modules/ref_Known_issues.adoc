* BZ#1709211: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1709211#c2[ESXi 5.5 requires VDDK version 6.7.0]
endif::[]

* BZ#1726939: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1726939[Run the preflight check of migration task before waiting for a conversion host]. Currently, the preflight check that monitors the migration is performed after a conversion host is assigned to the task. As a result, the total volume of the Datastores reported in *Migration Plans In Progress* reflects the total volume of the virtual machines that are currently migrating, not the total volume of the migration plan. When all the virtual machines have started to migrate, the correct value of the total volume is displayed.

* BZ#1791802: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791802[virt-v2v does not install qemu-ga on EL8 guest]. Currently, when migrating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 virtual machine, the Qemu guest agent is not installed. The impact is that the IP address of the virtual machine will not be reported in RHV inventory, and the post-migration playbook inventory will contain only "localhost". This may lead to unexpected behavior of the playbook. We recommend to not associate a post-migration playbook to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 virtual machines in a migration plan.

 this will be solved in virt-v2v-1.40.2-21.module+el8.2.0+5851+8d6a931b.x86_64.rpm, planned to be released with RHEL AV 8.2.0, i.e. in May.
