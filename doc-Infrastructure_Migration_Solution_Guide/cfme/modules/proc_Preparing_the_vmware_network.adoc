[id="Preparing_the_vmware_network_{context}"]
= Preparing the VMware network

Extend the VMware network to your Red Hat environment.

ifdef::rhv_1-3_vddk[]
Ensure that the VMware network provides high throughput (10 GbE) and does not affect production virtual machines (for example, a backup network).
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The network configuration must not be changed in any way during the migration.
* IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configuration must not be changed before or after migration because the conversion process preserves the source virtual machine MAC addresses.
