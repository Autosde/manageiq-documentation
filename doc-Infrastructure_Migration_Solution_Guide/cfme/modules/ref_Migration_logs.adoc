You can check the conversion host logs and the CloudForms migration log to identify the cause of a migration error.

[id="Conversion_host_logs_{context}"]
== Accessing the conversion host logs

When disk migration starts, two logs are created in the conversion host:

* `virt-v2v`: Debug output from `virt-v2v` itself. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine migration process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details. You can download access this log on the conversion host or download it in CloudForms.
* `virt-v2v-wrapper`: Log of the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting. You can access this log on the conversion host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you need to open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support call], you must submit both the migration (`virt-v2v`) log and `virt-v2v-wrapper` log for analysis.
====

To access the `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` logs on the conversion host:

. Log in to the conversion host using SSH.
+
If you are not sure which conversion host to log in to, click the information icon (image:Info_icon.png[20]) of a virtual machine in the migration plan details view.

. Go to `/var/log/vdsm/import/` to access the logs for each migration:
+
* `virt-v2v` log: +v2v-import-_date_-_log_number_.log+
* `virt-v2v-wrapper` log: +v2v-import-_date_-_log_number_-wrapper.log+

To download the `virt-v2v` log in CloudForms:

. Click menu:Compute[*Migration* > Migration Plans].
. Click a completed migration plan to view its details.
. Click menu:Download Log[Migration Log].

You can check the conversion host logs, playbook logs, and the CloudForms migration log to identify the cause of a migration error.

== Downloading the conversion host and playbook logs

You can download the conversion host and playbooks logs in CloudForms.

When disk migration starts, two logs are created in the conversion host:

* `virt-v2v`: Debug output from `virt-v2v` itself. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine migration process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details.
* `virt-v2v-wrapper`: Log of the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting.

If you open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support call], you will need to submit both the `virt-v2v` log and `virt-v2v-wrapper` log for analysis and troubleshooting.
====

To access the conversion host logs and the playbook logs:

. Click menu:Compute[*Migration* > Migration Plans].
. Click a completed migration plan to view its details.
. Click *Download Log* of a virtual machine and select a log from the dropdown list:

* *Premigration log* This option only appears if a premigration playbook is used.
* *Migration log* The *Migration log* is the `virt-v2v` log.
* *Virt-v2v-wrapper log*
* *Postmigration log* This option only appears if a postmigration playbook is used.

[id="Cloudforms_migration_log_{context}"]
== Accessing the CloudForms migration log

This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine migration in CloudForms.

To access the CloudForms migration log:

. Log into the CloudForms machine using SSH.
. The migration log is `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log`.
