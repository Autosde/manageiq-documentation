= Installing and configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform

. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[set at least one volume type] for the target block storage. Otherwise, CloudForms will not detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Red Hat Ceph Storage, you will require three times the space of the source virtual machines for the migrated virtual machines. A Ceph storage cluster, by default, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/3/html-single/architecture_guide/index#concept-arch-data-copies-arch[creates two copies of an object in a replicated storage pool], for a total of three copies.

The migrated disks use all of the space because it is preallocated. For example, a source virtual machine with a 100 GB disk requires 300 GB of storage, regardless of how much data the disk actually contains. To save storage space, you can use the `fstrim` command on the migrated virtual machines as a postmigration task or playbook.
====

. Create flavors for the source virtual machines. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.
