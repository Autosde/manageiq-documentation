ifdef::rhv_1-2[]
.Prerequisites

* If the Red Hat Virtualization provider has been active for a while, verify that the hosts have valid subscriptions and repositories:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --consumed
# yum repolist
----

* If a host has an SSH private key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`, delete the key manually before configuring the host. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite existing keys.
