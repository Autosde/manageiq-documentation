= Prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met in your Red Hat environment:

. Set the BIOS settings of physical hosts for optimal performance (rather than power-saving), according to the vendor's recommendations.
. Disable C1E halt state, if applicable.

ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk[]
. Enable the following ports in the conversion host network:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - Conversion hosts to vCenter

. Configure security groups with the following ports enabled:

* For the conversion hosts and CloudForms: port 22 (SSH)
* For CloudForms: port 443 (HTTPS)
