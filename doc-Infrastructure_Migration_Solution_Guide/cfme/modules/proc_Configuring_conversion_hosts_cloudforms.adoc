.Prerequisites

* If the Red Hat Virtualization provider has been active for a while, verify that each host has valid subscriptions and repositories by logging in using SSH and running the following commands:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --consumed
# yum repolist
----

* If a host has an SSH private key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`, delete the key manually before configuring the host. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite existing keys.
