= Preparing the VMware environment

Preparing the VMware environment for migration involves the following tasks:

. Extending the VMware network. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_network_{context}[].
. Preparing the VMware virtual machines. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines_for_{context}[].
. (Optional) Configuring a VMware hypervisor for more than ten concurrent migrations from that hypervisor. See xref:Configuring_vmware_hypervisor_for_more_than_10_concurrent_vddk_migrations_{context}[].

. (SSH only) Configuring the VMware hypervisors for SSH transformation, if you are not using VDDK. See xref:Configuring_the_vmware_hypervisors_for_ssh_transformation_{context}[].

You can prepare the VMware virtual machines. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines_for_{context}[].

include::proc_Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

If you are performing more than ten concurrent migrations from a VMware hypervisor, you must configure the hypervisor to support the additional connections. See xref:Configuring_vmware_hypervisor_for_more_than_10_concurrent_vddk_migrations_{context}[].

If you are using VDDK, you can prepare the target environment.

If you are using SSH transformation instead of VDDK, you must configure the VMware hypervisors for SSH. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines_for_{context}[].
