= Recommendations for migration

The following recommendations will minimize the impact of the migration on your environment.

.Scheduling the migration

* Schedule your migration carefully, to minimize the impact on your users.
* Prepare your users for downtime.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.
====
* Stagger the migration schedules.
* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.

[id="Distributing_the_migration_workload"]
.Distributing the migration workload

* Create migration groups, so that you are not migrating all of your virtual machines at the same time, keeping in mind the following considerations:

** How are the virtual machines grouped now?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** Which workloads or linked applications should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

[id="Deploying_conversion_hosts"]
.Deploying conversion hosts

* Create an appropriate number of conversion hosts. See xref:Deciding_how_many_conversion_hosts_to_create[]
* Choose the best datapath transformation option for your environment. See xref:Choosing_vddk_or_ssh_transformation[]
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform:
** Deploy conversion hosts on multiple compute nodes.
** Deploy conversion hosts on a compute node with nested virtualization enabled (see link:https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html[Configure DevStack with KVM-based Nested Virtualization]). Nested virtualization is a technology preview.

[id="Controlling_the_migration_process"]
.Controlling the migration process

* Create multiple xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plans] for finer control.
* Perform test migrations with different maximum numbers of concurrent migrations to assess the capabilities of your environment's infrastructure (see xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[]).
