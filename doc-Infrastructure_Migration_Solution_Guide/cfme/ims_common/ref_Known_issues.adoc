To obtain critical updates for the conversion hosts:

* Red Hat Virtualization: Run `yum update` on the conversion hosts.
* OpenStack Platform: Download the latest conversion host appliance and re-deploy the conversion hosts (see xref:Deploying_osp_conversion_hosts[]).

The following issues will be addressed in a future release:

* Canceling a migration does not stop the creation of volumes, instances, and network ports (OpenStack Platform), or virtual machines (Red Hat Virtualization). link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666799[]
