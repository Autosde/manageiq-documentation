[NOTE]
====
To obtain critical updates for the conversion hosts:

* Red Hat Virtualization: Run `yum update` on the conversion hosts.
* OpenStack Platform: Download the latest conversion host appliance and re-deploy the conversion hosts (see xref:Deploying_osp_conversion_hosts[]).
====

The following issues will be addressed in a future release:

* Canceling a migration does not stop the creation of volumes, instances, and network ports (OpenStack Platform), or virtual machines (Red Hat Virtualization). link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666799[]

* Migrating over SSH and VDDK transformation method with names containing international chars or spaces fails to migrate. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1678385[]

* Migration plan CSV import validation not working if file contains empty/archived/orphan/invalid VM name. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1699343[]

* *Maximum concurrent migrations per conversion host* interface control does not work. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1698761[]

* *Red Hat Virtualization*: Refreshing the hosts causes the network(s) and datastore to disappear from infrastructure mappings. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669176[]

* *OpenStack Platform*:

** Instance is not created after disk conversion. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1668049[]
** Names of virtual machines that were migrated using SSH transformation change during migration. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669133[]

* *CloudForms*: CFME 5.10.4 does not support migration. Use the following versions:

** OpenStack Platform (all versions): CFME 5.10.3
** Red Hat Virtualization 4.2: CFME 5.10.3
** Red Hat Virtualization 4.3: CFME 5.10.5

[NOTE]
====
You can use CFME 5.10.4 to manage your Red Hat Virtualization 4.3 environment. Only the migration functionality is affected.
