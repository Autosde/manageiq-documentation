= Creating an infrastructure mapping

The infrastructure mapping maps the resources of your source and target environments.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or remove providers or provider objects from an infrastructure mapping, the mapping will have missing resource errors (see xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[]). You must delete the infrastructure mapping and create a new one.

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].

^|Screen ^|Procedure

|*General*
.<a|. Enter the infrastructure mapping *Name* and (optional) *Description*.
. Select the *Target Provider*.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Compute*
.<a|. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* source cluster and a (RHV) *Target Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* or (OpenStack{nbsp}Platform) *Target Provider \ Project*.
+
If the target cluster or project does not contain a conversion host, a warning icon (image:warning.png[height=15px]) appears. You can create and save an infrastructure mapping, but you must xref:Configuring_the_conversion_hosts[configure conversion hosts] before you can run a migration plan.

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional clusters.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Storage*
.<a|. Select a source cluster whose datastores you want to map.
. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* and (RHV) *Target Datastores* or
(OpenStack{nbsp}Platform) *Target Provider \ Volume Type*. (If the OpenStack Platform volume type is missing, check that the `volume type` has been set. See xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[].)

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional datastores.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Networks*
.<a|. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
. Select one or more from *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* and a *Target Project \ Network*. (IMS supports both provider and tenant networks in OpenStack Platform.)

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map the networks of additional source clusters.
. Click *Create*.

|*Results*
.<a|Click *Close*. Your infrastructure mapping is saved in menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].
