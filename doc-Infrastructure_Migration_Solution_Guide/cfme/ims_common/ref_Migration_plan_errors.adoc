= Migration plan errors

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_discovered"]
* If the virtual machines are being migrated for the first time and are not discovered by the migration plan, check the source datastores and networks in the infrastructure mapping.

* If the virtual machines have been migrated in the past, they cannot be discovered by the migration plan. Use a xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file] to add the virtual machines to the migration plan.

[id="Virtual_machines_cannot_be_added_with_CSV_file"]
* If the virtual machines cannot be added to the migration plan with a CSV file, check the   xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan[CSV file format and fields]. Create a new migration plan with the updated CSV file.

* *Create Migration Plan* wizard hang while importing CSV file. This error is caused by an invalid CVS file (for example, virtual machines with a duplicate `Name` field and no `Host`/`Provider` field to distinguish them, or with a duplicate `Name` field and duplicate `Host`/`Provider` fields). You must reload the web page. This is a xref:Known_issues[known issue] and will be addressed in a future release.

* `Denied State` error (IMS 1.1). If a migration plan fails immediately and the migration plan displays a `Denied State` error message, check that you have created and configured the conversion hosts correctly. xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan[Cancel the migration plan] and xref:Retrying_a_failed_migration_plan[retry it].

* If you have not configured conversion hosts, the following error appears after running the migration plan (IMS 1.2): `Unable to migrate VMs because no conversion host was configured at the time of the attempted migration. See the product documentation for information on configuring conversion hosts.` You can create and save a migration plan whose infrastructure mapping does not contain conversion hosts, but you cannot run the migration plan without conversion hosts.
