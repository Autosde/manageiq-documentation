= Planning the migration

During the planning phase, you will formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000{nbsp}virtual machines, with 200{nbsp}TB of data, in less than 6 months".

The following information can help you plan your migration:

* Questions to ask before migration. See xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration[] for questions to consider, including the following:

** "How long will the migration take?"
** "How many conversion hosts do I need?"
** "Should I migrate my virtual machines using VDDK or SSH transformation?"

* Recommendations for a successful migration. See xref:Recommendations_for_migration[] for guidelines on the following topics:

** Scheduling the migration
** Distributing the migration workload
** Deploying conversion hosts
** Controlling the migration process
