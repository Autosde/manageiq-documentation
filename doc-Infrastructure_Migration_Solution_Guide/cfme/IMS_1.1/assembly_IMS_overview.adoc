= Infrastructure Migration Solution overview

The Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware 5.5 (and later) to the following target environments:

* Red Hat Virtualization 4.2
+
Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) is a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API (for more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization documentation]).

* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or 14
+
Red Hat OpenStack Platform enables you to create a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (for more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform documentation]).

The migration process is performed with CloudForms 4.7, a user interface for managing the infrastructure (for more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms documentation]).

The migration process has the following key steps:

. xref:Planning_the_migration[Planning the migration]:
+
* xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration[Questions to ask before migration] to estimate time and resource requirements, including the following:

** xref:How_long_will_the_migration_take["How long will the migration take?"]

** xref:Deciding_how_many_conversion_hosts_to_create["How many conversion hosts do I need?"]
** xref:Choosing_vddk_or_ssh_transformation["Which datapath transformation option should I use, VDDK or SSH?"]

* xref:Recommendations_for_migration[Recommendations to minimize the impact on your users]

. xref:Preparing_the_environment_for_migration[Preparing for migration]:
+
* xref:Preparing_the_vmware_source_environment[Preparing the VMware virtual machines for migration]
* xref:Preparing_the_target_environment[Preparing the Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment]
* xref:Configuring_the_conversion_hosts[Configuring the conversion hosts].  Conversion hosts are RHV hosts or Red Hat OpenStack Platform instances running `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper`, which perform the migration.

. xref:Migrating_the_infrastructure[Migrating the virtual machines]:
+
* xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping[Mapping the source and target environments]
* xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[Creating and running a migration plan]. For a detailed description of the migration process, see the migration workflows:
