Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) 1.1 enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to  Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms.

Red Hat Virtualization 4.2::
Red Hat Virtualization provides a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization 4.2] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_rhv[].

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_osp[].

Red Hat CloudForms 4.7.3::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. Red Hat CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms 4.7] documentation for more information.

The migration process involves the following tasks:

. Planning the migration. See xref:Planning_the_migration_{context}[].
. Preparing the VMware, Red Hat Virtualization, and CloudForms environments. See xref:Preparing_the_environment_for_migration_to_{context}[].
. Migrating the virtual machines. See xref:Migrating_the_virtual_machines_{context}[].
. Troubleshooting, if necessary. See xref:Troubleshooting_{context}[].

= Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization environment for SSH transformation

You can configure your environment for SSH transformation if you cannot use VDDK.

=== Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization conversion hosts

. Follow the procedures in xref:Configuring_the_1_1_{context}_conversion_hosts_for_vddk[], with the following changes:

.. xref:extra_vars_{context}[]: The `v2v_transport_methods` parameter in `extra_vars.yml` is `ssh` .
.. xref:secure_vars_{context}[]: The `v2v_ssh_private_key` parameter in `secure_vars.yml` is the SSH private key for connecting to the VMware hypervisors.
.. xref:Configuring_host_with_playbooks_{context}[]: No changes.

. Copy the VMware keys to the conversion hosts. See xref:Copying_vmware_keys_to_{context}_conversion_hosts[].
. Configure secure remote login to the VMware hypervisors. See xref:Configuring_secure_remote_login_to_the_vmware_hypervisors[].
. Authenticate the conversion hosts in CloudForms. See xref:Authenticating_rhv_conversion_hosts_in_cloudforms[].
