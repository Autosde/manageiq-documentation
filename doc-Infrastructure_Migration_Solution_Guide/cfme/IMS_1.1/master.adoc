Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) 1.1 enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to  Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms.

Red Hat Virtualization 4.2::
Red Hat Virtualization is a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization 4.2] documentation for more information.

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform enables you to create a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14] documentation for more information.

Red Hat CloudForms 4.7.3::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. Red Hat CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms 4.7] documentation for more information.

= Migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization

== Overview

Migrating your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization involves the following key tasks:

. Preparing your environment:
.. Preparing the VMware environment. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_environment_for_{context}[].
.. Preparing the Red Hat Virtualization environment. See xref:Preparing_the_1_1_rhv_environment[].
.. Configuring the conversion hosts. See xref:Configuring_the_1_1_rhv_conversion_hosts[].

. Migrating the virtual machines:
.. Creating an infrastructure mapping. See xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping_for_{context}[].
.. Checking for migration prerequisites. See xref:Checking_for_migration_prerequisites_{context}[].
.. Creating and running a migration plan. See xref:Creating_a_migration_plan_in_cloudforms_{context}[].

.Migration workflow

For details of the migration process, see the following diagram:

include::assembly_Configuring_the_1_1_rhv_conversion_hosts.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== Migrating the virtual machines

Migrating the virtual machines to Red Hat Virtualization involves the following key tasks:

. Mapping the resources of your VMware and Red Hat Virtualization environments. See xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping_for_{context}[].
. Checking for migration conditions with prerequisites. See xref:Checking_for_migration_prerequisites_{context}[].
. Creating and running a migration plan. See xref:Creating_a_migration_plan_in_cloudforms_{context}[].
. (Optional) You can change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers to control the migration process. See xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations_{context}[].

include::ims_common/proc_Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

After you have created an infrastructure mapping, you can check for migration prerequisites.

include::ims_common/proc_Creating_a_migration_plan_in_cloudforms.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

If errors occur during the migration process, see xref:Troubleshooting_{context}[].

(Optional) you can change the maximum number of concurrent migrations. See xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations_{context}[].
