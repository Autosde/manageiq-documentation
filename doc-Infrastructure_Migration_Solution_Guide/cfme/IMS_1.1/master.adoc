Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) 1.1 enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms.

Red Hat Virtualization 4.2::
Red Hat Virtualization provides a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization 4.2] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_rhv_1-1[].

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14] documentation for more information.Configuring_environment_for_ssh_transformation_{context}
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_osp_1-1[].

Red Hat CloudForms 4.7.0::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. Red Hat CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms 4.7] documentation for more information.

[id="Migrating_from_vmware_to_{context}"]
= Migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization

This guide describes how to plan your migration, to prepare the VMware source and Red Hat target environments, and to migrate the virtual machines.

== Planning the migration

During the planning phase, you will formulate a specific migration goal, for example, "I want to migrate 2000{nbsp}virtual machines, with 200{nbsp}TB of data, in less than 6 months".

Review the following information to plan your migration:

* xref:Questions_to_ask_before_migration_{context}[] includes the following:

** What operating systems are supported?
** How long will the migration take?
** How many conversion hosts do I need?

* xref:Recommendations_for_migration_{context}[] provides guidelines on the following topics:

** Scheduling the migration
** Distributing the workload
** Deploying the conversion hosts
** Controlling the migration process

include::modules/ref_Recommendations_for_migration.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="Preparing_the_migration_environment_{context}"]
== Preparing the migration environment

You must prepare the VMware source and Red Hat Virtualization target environments.

The virtual disks are converted with the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK). If you cannot use VDDK, xref:Configuring_environment_for_ssh_transformation_{context}[SSH transformation] is a fallback option.

[id="Preparing_the_vmware_environment_{context}"]
=== Preparing the VMware environment

You must prepare the VMware network and virtual machines for migration.

If you are performing more than ten concurrent migrations from a single VMware hypervisor, you must configure the hypervisor.

[id='Preparing_the_rhv_environment_{context}']
=== Preparing the Red Hat Virtualization environment

You must install and configure Red Hat Virtualization and CloudForms and deploy the conversion hosts.

include::modules/proc_Installing_configuring_cf.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[id='Deploying_conversion_hosts-{context}']
=== Deploying the Red Hat Virtualization conversion hosts

Deploying the conversion hosts involves the following tasks:

. Downloading the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)
. Configuring and verifying the conversion hosts with Ansible playbooks
. Authenticating the conversion hosts in CloudForms

include::modules/proc_Authenticating_rhv_conversion_hosts.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[id='Migrating_virtual_machines_{context}']
== Migrating the virtual machines

Migrating the virtual machines involves the following steps:

. Checking for migration conditions that have prerequisites
. Creating an infrastructure mapping to map the resources of your source and target environments
. Creating and running a migration plan in CloudForms

Optionally, you can xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations_{context}[change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers] to control the migration process.

=== Migration prerequisites

Check your migration for the following conditions, which have prerequisites:

* If you are migrating previously migrated virtual machines, you must xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan_{context}[add previously migrated machines to the migration plan with a CSV file]. A CSV file is also recommended for large migrations.

* If you are using Ansible playbooks for premigration/postmigration tasks, you must xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms_{context}[create an Ansible repository and add credentials and playbooks to CloudForms].

* If you are migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system, you must xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook_{context}[create a RHEL premigration playbook] to preserve IP addresses and select this playbook when you create a migration plan.

== Troubleshooting

You can review the migration logs, check common issues and mistakes, and known issues to troubleshoot a migration error.

[id='Configuring_environment_for_ssh_transformation_{context}']
== Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization environment for SSH transformation

You can configure your environment for SSH transformation if you cannot use VDDK.

This configuration involves adding the following steps to xref:Preparing_the_migration_environment_{context}[]:
