= Reinstalling `ipa-client`

If you are configuring the conversion hosts to use SSSD with single sign-on, you should reinstall `ipa-client` without the OpenSSH client. Otherwise, SSH will fail for the vdsm user. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[ipa-client-install changes system-wide SSH configuration]. This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the configuration file because the file is restored during upgrades.

On the Manager machine, run the following commands:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----
