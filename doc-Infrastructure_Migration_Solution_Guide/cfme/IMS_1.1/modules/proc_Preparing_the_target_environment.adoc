= Installing and configuring Red Hat Virtualization

. Install Red Hat Virtualization Manager 4.2 on the Manager machine (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#part-Installing_the_Red_Hat_Virtualization_Manager[Installing the Red Hat Virtualization Manager] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide_).

. Install Red Hat Virtualization Host 4.2 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 on physical machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Installing_RHVH[Installing Red Hat Virtualization Host] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/installation_guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_Hosts[Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Hosts] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide_).
+
[NOTE]
====
Some of these hosts will be deployed as conversion hosts. The number of conversion hosts depends on your migration size and infrastructure capabilities. See xref:Deciding_how_many_conversion_hosts_to_create[] for details.
====

. Enable the following ports in the conversion host network:
* 22 - SSH
* 443 - CloudForms, Red Hat Virtualization Manager, and VDDK
* 902 - CloudForms to VMware
* 5480 - Conversion hosts to vCenter
+
For details, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/417343[Ports used by Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1 and above].

. Create and attach data and ISO storage domains to the data center, ensuring that the data domains have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#chap-Storage[Storage] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_).
+
[NOTE]
====
IMS only supports shared storage, such as NFS, iSCSI, or FCP. Local storage is not supported.
====

. Upload the VirtIO and Guest Tool image files to the ISO storage domain (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html-single/administration_guide/#Uploading_the_VirtIO_and_Guest_Tool_Image_Files_to_an_ISO_Storage_Domain[Uploading the VirtIO and Guest Tool Image Files to an ISO Storage Domain] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_).
+
The VirtIO file name must include the version number: +virtio-win-_version_.iso+. The Guest Tool is required for migrating Windows virtual machines.

. Optionally, you can create a MAC address pool that includes the MAC addresses of the VMware virtual machines to be migrated (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/html/administration_guide/sect-mac_address_pools#Creating_MAC_Address_Pools[Creating MAC Address Pools] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Red Hat Virtualization MAC address pool range overlaps the VMware MAC address range, you must ensure that the MAC addresses of the migrating virtual machines do not duplicate those of existing virtual machines. Otherwise, the migration will fail.

If you do not create a MAC address pool, the migrated virtual machines will not have MAC addresses in the same range as virtual machines created in Red Hat Virtualization.
====

[id="Reinstalling_ipa_client"]
= Reinstalling `ipa-client`

If you are configuring the conversion hosts to use SSSD with single sign-on, you should reinstall `ipa-client` without the OpenSSH client. Otherwise, SSH will fail for the vdsm user (see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[ipa-client-install changes system-wide SSH configuration]). This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the configuration file because the file is restored during upgrades.

On the Manager machine, run the following commands:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----

[id="Installing_and_configuring_open_stack_platform"]
= Installing and configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform

. Install Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or 14 (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director Installation and Usage]).

. Create provider networks for the target instances to preserve the IP addresses of the source virtual machines (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[Create a network] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Networking Guide_).

. Create a project for the conversion hosts and whatever destination projects you require for the target instances (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#create_a_project[Create a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_).

. Ensure that the `admin` user has `member` and `admin` roles in the conversion and destination projects (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#edit_a_project[Edit a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_).

. Set at least one volume type for the target block storage (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a Volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[Changing a Volumeâ€™s Type (Volume Re-typing)] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Storage Guide_). Otherwise, CloudForms cannot detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Red Hat Ceph Storage, you will require three times the space of the source virtual machines for the migrated virtual machines because it creates two replicas of an object, for a total of three copies. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/3/html-single/storage_strategies_guide/index#get_the_number_of_object_replicas[Get the Number of Object Replicas] in the _Red Hat Ceph Storage: Storage Strategies Guide_.

The migrated virtual machines use all of the space because it is preallocated. For example, if you migrate a virtual machine with a 100 GB disk, you will require 300 GB of storage, regardless of how much data the disk contains. To reduce the space required, you can use the `fstrim` command on the migrated virtual machines as a postmigration task or playbook.
====

. Configure security groups with the following ports enabled:

* For the conversion hosts and CloudForms: port 22 (SSH)
* For CloudForms: port 443 (HTTPS)
+
[NOTE]
====
Outbound traffic is enabled by default. If you have changed this setting, enable ports 902 (CloudForms to VMware) and 5480 (conversion hosts to vCenter).
====

. Create flavors for the source virtual machines. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.

[[Cloudforms_for_rhv]]
. Install Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 on the Manager machine (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on Red Hat Virtualization]).
+
[NOTE]
====
CFME 5.10.4 does not support migration. See the xref:ref_Software_compatibility_matrix_rhv[software compatibility matrix] for details.
====

. Add VMware and Red Hat Virtualization as providers (see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#vmware_vcenter_providers[Adding a VMware vCenter Provider] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#adding_a_red_hat_virtualization_provider[Adding a Red Hat Virtualization Provider] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_) .
+
[NOTE]
====
Removing or changing a provider, including refreshing hosts, before, during, or after the migration will cause errors in the infrastructure mappings and migration plans.

[id="Deploying_osp_conversion_hosts"]
= Deploying Red Hat OpenStack Platform conversion hosts

You can download the conversion appliance (`RHOSP V2V Image for Red Hat OpenStack Director`) and use it to deploy the conversion host instances. The number of conversion hosts you deploy depends on your migration size and infrastructure capabilities. See xref:Deciding_how_many_conversion_hosts_to_create[] for details.

. Navigate to link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/[Red Hat Product Downloads].
. In the *A-Z* tab, click *Red Hat OpenStack Platform*.
. Click the green *Download Latest* button to go to the *Download Red Hat OpenStack Platform* page.
. In the *Product Software* tab, locate the latest version of the `RHOSP V2V Image for Red Hat OpenStack Director (x86_64)`, click the *Download Now* button, and save the image.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Always download the latest version to ensure that you have important patches and fixes. The `RHOSP V2V Image for Red Hat OpenStack Director (x86_64)` for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14 can be used with both Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14.
====

. Upload the appliance to Glance storage.
. Deploy the appliance as a conversion host instance, with the following resources:
+
** 4 vCPUs
** 1 GB RAM for each concurrent migration, starting at 10 GB RAM (the xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[default maximum number of concurrent migrations] per conversion host is `10`). If you raise the number of concurrent migrations, you should increase the RAM accordingly. If you lower the number of concurrent conversions, you should not go below 8 GB RAM.
** `/tmp` (1 GB for each concurrent migration)
** `/var/tmp` (1 GB for each concurrent migration)
** `/var/logs` (5 GB)
+
[NOTE]
====
For optimal performance:

* Deploy the conversion hosts on more than one hypervisor.
* Deploy the conversion hosts on a compute node with nested virtualization enabled. See link:https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html[Configure DevStack with KVM-based Nested Virtualization]. Nested virtualization is a technology preview.
====

. Increase the disk space of the instance to accommodate its file system.
+
The instance is created from an image, but the disk space defined in the image will not be sufficient. You can either extend the partition, and subsequently extend the PV in the VG, to the required size, or you can create a new partition and add it as a PV to the VG.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must resize `lv_root` to use all available disk space because the image will not use it by default.
