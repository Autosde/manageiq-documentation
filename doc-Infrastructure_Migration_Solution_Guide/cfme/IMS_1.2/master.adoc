Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) 1.2 enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to  Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms:

Red Hat Virtualization 4.3::
Red Hat Virtualization provides a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.3/[Red Hat Virtualization 4.3] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_rhv[].

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_osp[].

Red Hat CloudForms 4.7.6 or later::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. Red Hat CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms 4.7] documentation for more information.

[id="Preparing_the_environment_for_migration_to_{context}"]
== Preparing the environment for migration

You must prepare the VMware environment, install and configure the target environment, and deploy your conversion hosts for VDDK transformation.

include::modules/ref_Vddk_note.adoc[]

[id="Preparing_the_vmware_environment_for_{context}"]
=== Preparing the VMware environment

You must prepare the VMware network and virtual machines for migration.

If you are performing more than ten concurrent migrations from a single VMware hypervisor, you must configure the hypervisor.
